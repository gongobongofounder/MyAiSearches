Yes, you can achieve this by creating a **persistent live USB**. A persistent live USB allows you to boot an operating system (like Ubuntu or Kali Linux) from the USB drive, and any changes you make (files saved, software installed, system settings adjusted) will be stored on the USB itself. This means that the next time you boot from the same USB drive, all your changes will be retained, just like on a physical hard drive.

### Steps to Create a Persistent Live USB

1. **Download the Linux Distribution ISO:**
   - Download the ISO file for the Linux distribution you want to use. For example, you could download Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or any other distro that supports live USBs.

2. **Download Rufus:**
   - Download and run [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), a tool for creating bootable USB drives.

3. **Insert the USB Drive:**
   - Insert a USB drive with enough space (at least 8 GB, but more is recommended if you need persistence).

4. **Launch Rufus:**
   - Open Rufus and select your USB drive.

5. **Select the ISO File:**
   - Under "Boot selection," click "SELECT" and choose the ISO file you downloaded.

6. **Set the Partition Scheme:**
   - Set the partition scheme according to your system (MBR for BIOS or GPT for UEFI).

7. **Enable Persistence:**
   - This is where the magic happens:
     - **Persistent Storage:** Rufus provides an option to create a persistent storage area on the USB. 
     - **Persistent partition size:** Rufus will allow you to select the amount of space you want to allocate for persistence. This space will be used to store your changes and files. You can adjust the slider to choose the size of the persistent partition.

8. **Start the Process:**
   - Click "START" to begin the process of creating the persistent live USB.

9. **Boot from USB:**
   - After the process is complete, reboot your computer.
   - Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing a key like F2, F12, DEL, or ESC during boot) and change the boot order to boot from USB.
   - Save and exit BIOS/UEFI. Your computer should now boot into the Linux OS on the USB drive.

### Important Notes:

- **Persistence Limitations:**
  - The persistent storage is typically stored in a special file on the USB drive (e.g., `casper-rw` for Ubuntu). While it retains most of your changes, there are some limitations (e.g., kernel upgrades might not be preserved).
  
- **Performance:**
  - Running an OS from a USB drive, even with persistence, can be slower compared to running from an internal SSD or HDD due to USB bandwidth limitations.

- **Security:**
  - If you're using a persistent USB on multiple computers, be mindful of the security risks. It's easier for the USB to be compromised if it's used on an untrusted system.

### Summary:

By creating a persistent live USB, you can boot an operating system from the USB drive and retain any changes you make, similar to using a physical disk. This allows you to avoid data loss and pick up right where you left off whenever you boot from the USB drive again. Tools like Rufus make the creation of persistent live USBs straightforward and accessible.
