Yes, if a persistent USB is compromised, it can pose a risk to your host OS when you boot your computer with the USB plugged in. Here’s how this could happen and some steps you can take to minimize the risk:

### Potential Risks:
1. **Auto-Mounting:**
   - **Auto-Mount Behavior:** If your host OS automatically mounts the USB drive when it is plugged in, malware on the USB could execute or modify files on the host OS. Many modern operating systems have measures to prevent this, but it's still a risk, especially on less secure or older systems.

2. **Bootloader and Firmware Attacks:**
   - **Malicious Bootloader:** If the compromised USB modifies the bootloader (like GRUB), it could potentially alter the way your host OS starts, inserting malicious code into the boot process.
   - **UEFI/BIOS Exploits:** Advanced malware could target the system's firmware (BIOS/UEFI), compromising the entire system even if the USB isn’t the primary boot device.

3. **File System Infections:**
   - **File Executables:** If you manually access the USB drive from your host OS and execute a compromised file, malware could infect the host system.
   - **Cross-Contamination:** If your host OS has any vulnerabilities, the USB could exploit these to spread malware onto the internal drive.

4. **Network Worms and Malware:**
   - **Network Propagation:** If the compromised USB contains malware that is network-aware, it might spread to other systems on the same network, including your host OS, when the USB is plugged in.

### Preventive Measures:
1. **Disable Auto-Mounting:**
   - **Manually Mount USBs:** Configure your host OS to not automatically mount USB drives. This gives you the chance to manually inspect the USB before accessing it.
  
2. **Scan the USB:**
   - **Antivirus/Malware Tools:** Before accessing any files on the USB, run a full scan with updated antivirus or anti-malware software.

3. **Use a Virtual Machine:**
   - **Sandbox Environment:** Access the USB within a virtual machine (VM) rather than directly on your host OS. This provides an additional layer of isolation, so if the USB is compromised, the VM can act as a containment zone.

4. **Update System Firmware:**
   - **BIOS/UEFI Updates:** Ensure your system firmware is up-to-date with the latest security patches to minimize the risk of firmware-level attacks.

5. **Secure Boot:**
   - **Enable Secure Boot:** If supported, enable Secure Boot in your UEFI settings to prevent unauthorized code from running during the boot process.

6. **Disconnect USB When Not Needed:**
   - **Physical Security:** Unplug the USB when you’re not actively using it, especially when booting your host OS, to avoid accidental execution of compromised files.

### Summary:
If a persistent USB is compromised, it can pose a risk to your host OS, particularly if the USB is automatically mounted, or if you execute files from it. To protect your host OS, disable auto-mounting, scan the USB for malware, and consider using virtual machines or other isolation techniques when interacting with the USB. Additionally, keeping your system firmware up-to-date and using features like Secure Boot can provide further protection against potential attacks.
