Creating a USB ISO file flasher like Rufus in Python is a complex task, but it's possible. This process involves several steps, including:

1. **USB Detection**: Identifying and selecting the correct USB device.
2. **Partitioning and Formatting**: Preparing the USB drive by creating a partition table and formatting it to a specific file system.
3. **Writing the ISO**: Writing the ISO file to the USB drive, which involves copying files and making the USB bootable.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensuring the process can handle errors like write failures or incorrect USB selection.

Here’s a high-level overview of how you can achieve this using Python:

### 1. **Detect USB Drives**

You can use the `psutil` or `pyudev` libraries to detect connected USB drives.

```python
import psutil

def detect_usb_drives():
    drives = []
    partitions = psutil.disk_partitions()
    for partition in partitions:
        if 'removable' in partition.opts:
            drives.append(partition.device)
    return drives
```

### 2. **Partition and Format the USB Drive**

You can use the `subprocess` module to call system commands like `fdisk`, `mkfs`, and `dd` for partitioning and formatting.

```python
import subprocess

def format_usb_drive(drive):
    # Unmount the drive
    subprocess.run(['umount', drive], check=True)
    
    # Create a new partition table (example with MBR)
    subprocess.run(['parted', drive, 'mklabel', 'msdos'], check=True)
    
    # Create a primary partition
    subprocess.run(['parted', drive, 'mkpart', 'primary', '0%', '100%'], check=True)
    
    # Format the partition to FAT32
    partition = f"{drive}1"
    subprocess.run(['mkfs.vfat', '-F', '32', partition], check=True)
```

### 3. **Write the ISO to the USB**

To write the ISO, you can use `dd` via `subprocess` or a library like `pycdlib` to directly handle ISO images.

```python
def write_iso_to_usb(iso_path, drive):
    # Use dd to write the ISO
    subprocess.run(['dd', f'if={iso_path}', f'of={drive}', 'bs=4M', 'status=progress'], check=True)
```

### 4. **Combine All Steps**

Finally, combine all the steps into a single function that orchestrates the entire process.

```python
def flash_iso_to_usb(iso_path, drive):
    try:
        print("Formatting the USB drive...")
        format_usb_drive(drive)
        
        print("Writing ISO to the USB drive...")
        write_iso_to_usb(iso_path, drive)
        
        print("USB drive is ready!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### 5. **Error Handling and User Interface**

You should implement error handling to deal with possible issues like insufficient permissions or a full USB drive. A GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` could also improve usability.

### Important Considerations:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The above code works on Linux. For Windows or macOS, you’d need to adapt the system commands accordingly.
- **Permissions**: Writing to disks usually requires elevated permissions (e.g., `sudo` on Linux).
- **Data Loss**: This script will overwrite the contents of the USB drive, so ensure that the user confirms their selection.

### Alternatives:
For a more robust solution, you might consider using existing tools or libraries like `balenaEtcher`, or building on top of them.

This example demonstrates the core idea, but creating a full-fledged tool like Rufus would require additional features and a lot of testing.
