**Secure Boot** is a security feature that helps protect your system from malicious software during the boot process. It ensures that only trusted software with a valid digital signature, such as the operating system's bootloader, can be loaded.

### Secure Boot and Live Booting:

1. **Compatibility with Live USBs:**
   - **Secure Boot and Official Linux Distributions:** Most major Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, provide signed bootloaders that are compatible with Secure Boot. This means you can create a live USB of these distributions and boot them on systems with Secure Boot enabled without issues.
   - **Unsigned or Custom Linux Distributions:** If you try to boot a custom or less common Linux distribution that doesn't have a signed bootloader, Secure Boot might prevent it from loading.

2. **When Secure Boot is Needed:**
   - **Prevents Rootkits and Bootkits:** Secure Boot is particularly useful for preventing rootkits or bootkits that might try to load before the operating system and compromise your system's security.
   - **Maintains Integrity of Boot Process:** By ensuring that only signed, trusted code runs during boot, Secure Boot helps maintain the integrity of the boot process.

3. **When Secure Boot is Optional:**
   - **Testing or Troubleshooting:** If you are using a live USB for testing or troubleshooting purposes and know the source of the Linux distribution is trustworthy, you can technically disable Secure Boot if it's causing issues. However, this reduces security.
   - **Custom Kernels or Modifications:** If you are working with custom kernels or making modifications that require disabling Secure Boot, you can temporarily turn it off. Just be aware of the potential security risks.

4. **Disabling Secure Boot:**
   - **Temporary Disable:** If Secure Boot is preventing your live USB from booting and you trust the software, you can disable Secure Boot in the UEFI/BIOS settings. Remember to re-enable it after you're done to maintain your system's security.
   - **Custom Keys:** For advanced users, some UEFI firmware allows you to add your own keys or enroll the bootloader's signature manually, enabling Secure Boot while allowing your custom software to run.

### Summary:
Secure Boot is generally beneficial when live booting, especially with well-known Linux distributions, as it enhances security by ensuring only signed and trusted bootloaders are used. However, if you're using a custom or unsigned distribution that doesn't support Secure Boot, you may need to temporarily disable it. Enabling Secure Boot is not strictly necessary for live booting, but it is recommended for maintaining a secure boot process.
