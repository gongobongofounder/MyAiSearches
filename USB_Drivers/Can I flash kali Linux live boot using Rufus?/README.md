Yes, you can use Rufus to flash Kali Linux for live boot on a USB drive. Rufus is a popular tool for creating bootable USB drives, and it works well with Kali Linux, among other operating systems.

### Steps to Flash Kali Linux Live Boot Using Rufus

Here’s how you can do it:

#### 1. **Download Kali Linux ISO**
   - Go to the [official Kali Linux website](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) and download the ISO file for the version of Kali Linux you want to use. Ensure you select the correct version (e.g., live boot) for your needs.

#### 2. **Download and Install Rufus**
   - Download Rufus from the [official Rufus website](https://rufus.ie/).
   - It’s a lightweight tool, and you can either install it or run it as a portable application.

#### 3. **Prepare Your USB Drive**
   - Insert your USB drive into your computer. Make sure the USB drive is empty or that you’ve backed up any important data, as the drive will be formatted during the flashing process.

#### 4. **Launch Rufus**
   - Open Rufus. It should automatically detect your USB drive.

#### 5. **Select the Kali Linux ISO**
   - In Rufus, under the "Boot selection" section, click on the "SELECT" button.
   - Navigate to where you downloaded the Kali Linux ISO and select it.

#### 6. **Choose Partition Scheme and Target System**
   - **Partition Scheme:** Rufus will typically detect the appropriate partition scheme (MBR or GPT) based on your system, but you can manually select it:
     - Use **MBR** if your system uses BIOS or is older.
     - Use **GPT** if your system uses UEFI.
   - **Target System:** This will automatically adjust based on the partition scheme (BIOS or UEFI).

#### 7. **File System**
   - Rufus will select the appropriate file system (usually FAT32) for you, but if it doesn’t, you can manually choose FAT32, as it’s broadly compatible.

#### 8. **Start the Flashing Process**
   - Click "START" to begin the process.
   - Rufus might ask how to write the image—select "Write in ISO Image mode (Recommended)" if prompted.
   - Confirm any warnings about data being destroyed on the USB drive.

#### 9. **Wait for the Process to Complete**
   - Rufus will take a few minutes to create the bootable USB drive.
   - Once done, it will notify you that the process is complete.

#### 10. **Boot from the USB Drive**
   - Restart your computer.
   - Enter the BIOS/UEFI setup (usually by pressing a key like F2, F12, DEL, or ESC during boot).
   - Change the boot order to prioritize booting from USB.
   - Save changes and exit BIOS/UEFI.
   - The computer should now boot into Kali Linux from the USB drive.

### Additional Tips

- **Persistence**: If you want to use a persistent live USB (where changes made during a session are saved), you’ll need to configure persistence during the creation of the USB. Rufus doesn’t directly support persistence, but you can set it up manually after flashing the USB.

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that your USB drive has enough capacity (at least 8 GB is recommended) and that your system is compatible with the Kali Linux version you are flashing.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a bootable Kali Linux USB drive using Rufus and use it to run Kali Linux in live mode on almost any computer.
