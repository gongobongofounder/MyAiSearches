If your BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is compromised by malware, it can be challenging to clean it. BIOS/UEFI malware is particularly dangerous because it can persist even if the operating system is reinstalled or the hard drive is replaced. Here’s how you can address a compromised BIOS/UEFI:

### 1. **Confirming BIOS/UEFI Compromise**
   - **Unusual System Behavior:** Inconsistent system behavior, changes in BIOS/UEFI settings without your input, or system instability may indicate a BIOS/UEFI compromise.
   - **Security Tools:** Some advanced anti-virus and anti-malware tools can scan the BIOS/UEFI for known threats, but detection is not always guaranteed.

### 2. **Updating or Re-Flashing the BIOS/UEFI**
   - **Download Official Firmware:** Obtain the latest BIOS/UEFI firmware directly from your motherboard or system manufacturer’s official website.
   - **Follow Manufacturer Instructions:** Manufacturers typically provide a utility or instructions on how to update or re-flash the BIOS/UEFI. This process involves overwriting the existing firmware with a clean, updated version.
   - **Ensure Proper Power Supply:** Ensure your computer remains powered during the update. A power loss during re-flashing could permanently damage the motherboard.

### 3. **Using a BIOS/UEFI Recovery Feature**
   - **Recovery Mode:** Some motherboards come with a BIOS/UEFI recovery feature that allows you to restore a clean version of the firmware. This might involve using a specific key combination during boot or a dedicated recovery jumper on the motherboard.
   - **Dual BIOS Systems:** Some high-end motherboards feature dual BIOS chips. If one BIOS chip is compromised, you can switch to the backup chip.

### 4. **Clearing the CMOS**
   - **What is CMOS?** The CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) stores BIOS settings. Clearing the CMOS can reset BIOS settings to their default state, but it won’t remove malware embedded in the firmware.
   - **How to Clear CMOS:** Disconnect the computer from power, locate the CMOS battery on the motherboard, remove it for a few minutes, then reinsert it. Alternatively, some motherboards have a "Clear CMOS" jumper that can be used.

### 5. **Replacing the BIOS Chip**
   - **Replaceable Chips:** On some motherboards, the BIOS chip is socketed and can be physically removed and replaced. This is a more advanced procedure that requires obtaining a new, clean BIOS chip from the manufacturer or a trusted vendor.
   - **Professional Help:** If you are uncomfortable with this process, you can seek help from a professional technician.

### 6. **Replacing the Motherboard**
   - **Last Resort:** If re-flashing or replacing the BIOS chip isn’t possible or doesn’t resolve the issue, replacing the entire motherboard may be the only way to ensure the malware is completely removed.
   
### 7. **Restoring Trust in the System**
   - **Reinstall the Operating System:** After cleaning or replacing the BIOS/UEFI, reinstall the operating system to ensure that any rootkits or other persistent malware at the OS level are removed.
   - **Scan for Malware:** Use trusted anti-virus and anti-malware tools to scan the system after reinstalling the OS to ensure no malware remains.

### 8. **Preventing Future Attacks**
   - **Keep BIOS/UEFI Updated:** Regularly update your BIOS/UEFI to the latest version, as updates may include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.
   - **Enable Secure Boot:** If your motherboard supports UEFI Secure Boot, enable it. This feature ensures that only signed and trusted firmware and OS bootloaders can be loaded.
   - **Be Cautious with USB Drives:** Avoid using untrusted USB drives or devices, as they can be a vector for spreading BIOS/UEFI malware.
   - **Network Security:** Ensure your network is secure, as BIOS/UEFI malware can sometimes be spread through network vulnerabilities.

### Summary:
Addressing a compromised BIOS/UEFI is complex and may require re-flashing or replacing the firmware, or in some cases, replacing the motherboard itself. Ensuring the BIOS/UEFI is secure and regularly updated, along with following safe computing practices, is key to preventing such attacks.
